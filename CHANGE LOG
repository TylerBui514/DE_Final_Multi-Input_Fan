//PRE-8-Jan-2022//
  - Coding for the button and motion sensor
  - Constructing the circuit, including attatching the Arduino board
  - Installation of indicator LEDs

//8-Jan-2022//
  - Begin coding of the DHT11 sensor, using most code form sources and modifying for the project. 
  - Testing alternate power source with the fan, does not work.
    **Stronger power source needed**
  

//9-Jan-2022//
  - Finish coding and testing of the DHT11 Temperature Sensor. Able to detect temp, humidity, and changes.
    **Only works with a high enough voltage**
  - Test 16x2 LCD. Powers on but does not work. Likley not having a temperature display. 
  - Addition of Color Coded Wires on Arduino

//10-Jan-2022//
  - Test increased voltage on the circuit. Turns the fan on and can somewhat get triggered by the different inputs.
  - Temperature Sensor not working, even under high voltage.
  - Created GitHub repository. 
  - Problems uploading info to board, "Content Mismatch" 
  
//11-Jan-2022//
  - Tested different ways to fix "Contnet Mismatch Error" including different USB Cables, Ports, Arduino Uno Board, and reinstalling the program
    **NONE OF THE SOLUTIONS WORKED**
